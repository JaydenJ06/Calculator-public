   * Adds a digit to the calculator's display.
   *
   * For example, if the display is "8", calling addDigit("2") will change
   * the display to "82".
   *
   * There is also a helper function in `utils.ts` called `reformatDisplayText`,
   * which will correctly format the display text. It is important to reformat
   * the display text after adding a digit to ensure that the display is always
   * correctly formatted. For example, if the display reads "123" and the user
   * presses the "4" button without reformatting, the display would read "1234".
   * Instead, we want the display to be reformatted so it displays "1,234".
   *
   * There are a few special cases to consider:
   * - If the display is "0":
   *       The display should change to the digit being added, rather than
   *       appending the digit to the end of the display. For example,
   *       calling addDigit("3") when the display is "0" should change the
   *      display to "3", not "03".
   * - If the display already contains a decimal point:
   *      The display should not add a second decimal point. For example,
   *      if the display reads "3.14", calling addDigit(".") should do nothing.
   * - If the inputted digit is a decimal (.) or 0 (when a decimal is in the display):
   *      Do not reformat the display text as mentioned above. Imagine the
   *      user is trying to type "123.4". Once the user types the ".",
   *      reformatting "123." would result in "123", preventing the user from
   *      typing the "4". Or, if the user was trying to type "123.08", once the
   *      user types the "0", reformatting "123.0" would result in "123", which
   *      prevents the user from typing the ".08"!
   *
   * @param digit: String representation of the digit to add to the display,
   * passed in from `main.ts` when a digit button is clicked.

  /**
   * This method handles when a user clicks an operation button on the calculator,
   * storing this operation so that it can be applied after the user types in
   * the second operand.
   *
   * This method takes in a `SupportedOperation` enum value, which is defined in
   * `operation.ts`. This value is passed in from `main.ts` when an operation button
   * is clicked on the calculator. Depending on the passed in operation enum value,
   * we want to set the `selectedOperation` field to an appropriate `CalculatorOperation`.
   *
   * This method should perform three steps:
   * 1. If there is *already* a selected operation, that means that the user is chaining
   *    operations together (for example, 2 + 3 + 4). Therefore, we want to perform the
   *    calculation immediately before continuing on with future steps.
   *    Hint: You should just use the `calculate` method to perform the calculation.
   * 2. Set the `selectedOperation` field to the appropriate `CalculatorOperation` object.
   *    Learn more about the `CalculatorOperation` interface in `operation.ts`. Depending
   *    on the inputted `operation`, you want to set the `selectedOperation` field to an
   *    object with the appropriate values set to the fields. You will need to determine
   *    the correct symbol and operator function to set based on the inputted `operation`!
   *    Note: The operator function only takes in the second operand. The first operand
   *          should be determined based on the `previousSolution` field.
   * 3. Assign `previousSolution` to the current display's value. This will
   *    allow the user to type in the second operand after selecting an operation. Then,
   *    set the display to 0 so that the user can type in the second operand.
   *
   * @param operation: `SupportedOperation` enum value representing the operation to perform.
